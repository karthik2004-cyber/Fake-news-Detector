 In the digital era, the spread of fake news has become a major concern, influencing public opinion and leading to misinformation. A Fake News Detection System aims to classify news articles as real or fake using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The system will be trained on labeled datasets to identify deceptive content effectively.

 The Fake News Detection System leverages machine learning and NLP to classify news articles accurately. By deploying it as a web application, it can serve as a valuable tool for fact-checking and reducingÂ misinformation.
